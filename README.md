Tesla Camera

This is a very simple python 3 script to help me consolidate my Tesla's raw camera data into nicely formatted videos.  It tries to maintain the same resolution as the original with the same video quality.

This also makes use of my nvidia video card GPUs to accelerate encoding.

Help:
python3 teslacam.py --help
